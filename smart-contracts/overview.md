# Overview

The 2023 version of Animeme Labs Smart Contracts - starting with the [Dekoh](https://opensea.io/collection/dekoh) Collection, are based on [Roji's](https://roji.io) set of [Diamond 2535 Facets](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).&#x20;

### Dekoh

The Dekoh Collection is based on an [ERC721A](https://www.erc721a.org/) facet for low cost minting, published on Ethereum Mainnet. This is an open collection.

The contract can be found at [louper.dev](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x11b2164DDf1C3c0a420cEaD050d422B26530d11C?network=mainnet) which provides a great inspection feature. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x11b2164DDf1C3c0a420cEaD050d422B26530d11C) does not yet display Diamond Smart Contracts together with it's facets.

Smart Contracts are licensed from Roji.
